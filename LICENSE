Note added to the MIT license for the software project "corpsblog"

Some components of this directory hierarchy come from other sources, and
may be covered by a different license.  In this event, the author has made
a good-faith effort to provide the appropriate license, including a copy
in the base directory of the imported component in the case where the 
source provided it there.  I did not knowingly remove any copyright messages.
