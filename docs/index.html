<h2>Top-level Design</h2>
<p>Here's a quick sketch of some of the top-level classes
in Corpsblog:</p>

<h2>HTML Builder</h2>

<p>One of the things I was experimenting with when I first wrote
this was using Kotlin's
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html">Type-Safe
Builder</a> pattern.  It works OK, though at the time (with Kotlin 1.0)
the lack of the
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-dsl-marker/index.html"><code>@DslMarker</code></a> tag
caused a nasty surprise, when a builder function from an outer scope
was invoked.  I added <code>startInitAssert()</code> and
<code>endInitAssert()</code> to <code>TagParent</code> to detect that.
<code>@DslMarker</code> is a better solution, but I left the assertions
in there anyway, since they don't hurt anything.
</p><p>
The builder pattern works, but it does really force you through a bit
of a labyrinth of method-with-receiver to figure out what's going on.
That's OK, really - it's an extremely useful part of the language,
and doing the builder patter forces one to master it.
</p><p>
The builder I have here is incomplete, in that I didn't try to encode
strict HTML validity rules into the type declarations.  For example,
I let body tags to be embedded inside just about any other body tag,
which is of course invalid.  To actually get this right, and to give
a stronger guarantee of valid HTML5 in other ways would be a pretty big,
detail-oriented project.  In essence, one would have to build a proactive
HTML5 validator, at least for the HTML5 subset of interest.  Were I making
a production system for wide deployment, that would be worth some
effort, but for this experiment/prototype, I decided not to do this.
</p><p>Here's a sketch of the HTML builder classes.  Many of these
classes are very small; they're in <code>Html.kt</code>.

Sample output is <a href="test/index.html">available here</a>.  It
is generated from the <code>test</code> directory.
