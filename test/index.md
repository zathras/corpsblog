This is test content for the CorpsBlog static site generator.  The source for
the site is in the directory "test," and it gets generated to the directory
"docs."  It gets published at
[https://zathras.github.io/corpsblog/](https://zathras.github.io/corpsblog/).

You'll notice that links to the first and last post are put at both the top and
the bottom of the page.  That might look a little funny when the top page is short,
like this one, but I expect the top page to be longer.  In that case, it's nice to
give the reader a convenient means to get to the blog content, whichever way the
page is scrolled.
