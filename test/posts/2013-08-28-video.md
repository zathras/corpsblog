Here is some text, before we have a video.  I kind of wonder how I want
to handle portrait videos.  They're kind of annoying.  Maybe they're not
worth putting too much effort into?  Oh, but wait -- I need to know the
video dimensions anyway, or else I'd mess up the aspect ratio.  Hmm.  I
hate to overly re-invent that wheel.

## First video - an old at 640x480
$video$ 640 480
~/github/moom-www/movies/2006_09_bethlehem_directors_cut_h264.mp4
  Bethlehem is a really beautiful city, albeit tragically under-touristed. 
  Take a tour through Manger Square, see kids at a summer camp, 
  and see a Palestinian fashion show!

OK, that's the first video.

## Second video - HD resolution, portrait
$video$ 960 540
~/Dropbox/Camera Uploads/2016-11-20 20.34.38.mp4
  Not a terribly exciting video

## Third video - HD, landscape, no caption
$video$ 540 960
~/Dropbox/Camera Uploads/2016-11-20 20.33.55.mp4

## End

That's all, folks!
